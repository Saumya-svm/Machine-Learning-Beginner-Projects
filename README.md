# Machine-Learning-Beginner-Projects

This is my first try at implementing a ML algorithm on a dataset. In this project I have predicted the price of cars using K-Nearest-Neighbours, creating both univariate and mulitvariate models.

This repository also contains a guided project of Linear Regeression which was my first ML project. I learnt some useful methods during this project which helped me with the KNN project.

The data analysis and visualisation project regarding traffic on I-94 was my first guided project which helped me complete analysing e-Bay sales more independently. The latter does not include data visualisation, and I am intending to include it in the coming days.
